##Description
This is a site demonstrating my abilities with JS. The site generates a password based on user choices for character types and length of the password.

##Installation
There is no installation needed as this will work with any browser.

##Usage
In order to generate a password, the user needs to activate the toggle switch next to the character types they would like in the password (lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters). The user will then need to use the slider to pick a password character length. Once the character types and length have been selected, the user will press the "Generate Password" button. As long as at least one character type is selected, a password will be generated based off of the user's choices.

##Credits
Some code ideas for the final code is based on code found on webdevtricks.com
